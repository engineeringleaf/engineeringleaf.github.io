# Resources for generating websites with Jeykll and github.

1. Find a jeykll theme that suits your needs.
  * [github supported themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/)
  * [a list of other themes](https://jekyllthemes.io/free) - note, if using not default supported themes (and the theme is structured as a gem), you'll have to [setup a remote theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/#remote-theme-method)
2. Create a project in github with the name [username].github.io
  * [from a blank repository](https://github.com/new)
  * by clicking 'fork' on someone else's repository (given the license file allows)
3. Modify files (can be done within the webbrowser)
